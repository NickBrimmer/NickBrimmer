### <br> Hello, I'm Nick! 

<br> I'm a full stack developer in Portland, Oregon area. I have a passion for front end engineering (I love React). I spend my time creating and tinkering in JavaScript and TypeScript. Know someone interested in a React or JavaScript/TypeScript developer? Reach out! Nickbrimmer@gmail.com
<br><br>
As a full stack developer, <strong> here's what I do on any given day.</strong>
