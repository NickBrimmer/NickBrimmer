### <br> Hello, I'm Nick!

I'm a front end developer in Portland, Oregon area. I have a passion for front end engineering (I love React). I spend my time creating and tinkering in JavaScript and TypeScript. Know someone interested in a React or JavaScript/TypeScript developer? 
<br><br>
If you're here, you should also checkout my portfolio site: https://nickbrimmer.dev/

## I am currently migrating a legacy React eCommerce store to TypeScript:

### Feel free to browse some other current portfolio projects: 
1. My portfolio site is deployed using Gatsby and GraphQL (https://nickbrimmer.dev/), codebase: https://github.com/NickBrimmer/nick-codes.com2.0
2. I'm passionate about food, so I made a react website for it (https://tastyfoodwebsite.netlify.app/), codebase: https://github.com/NickBrimmer/tastyfood.com
